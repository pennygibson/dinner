			<p>We talked and cuddled for a while and it was during this conversation that something came up about people waiting to have sex until marriage. He thinks the sex will be good for them because they're in love. Of course I disagreed and somehow it came around to the sex with him being so good for me, he said, "obviously it's because you're in love with me." The ex accused me of being in love with The New Guy earlier that day when he came over for some website stuff. Obviously I denied this allegation both times; I can't be in love with someone after four months. </p>
						
			<p>Before I knew it it was time for him to leave. I asked him to stay and cuddle with me for ten more minutes, I love that he never says no to this, he doesn't even complain. He was lying on his back naked when I rolled on top of him; he started massaging my back, it was perfect. Naturally being on top of him with his hands all over my back quickly turned me on, after the massage  when my ten minutes were up I rolled off of him but before he could reach for his pants my hand had reached his balls. </p>
						
			<p>It didn't take long at all for him to get hard again.  He was super tired; I knew when Iâ€™d initiated this that I was on top. I went down on him again but this time I started by licking and sucking his balls before moving up for a couple of minutes to get it nice and wet to slide into my pussy.</p>
			
			<p>It was amazing the entire time. I got off and he hadn't so I kept going very slowly then as I was moving slowly lying on top of him he started pushing up and right after he came I got off AGAIN! God maybe I do love him!? Fuck. It's hard not to when the person gets you off so much and so easily. I don't even want to know how loudly I was moaning in his ear that time. That did come up in conversation earlier and I had asked, "do you ever wish I would just shut up?" He laughed, "no, I like it. It turns me on even more knowing how into it you are." </p>

			<p> Everything with him seems incredibly simple and it makes me wonder why all of my relationships before this have been so fucking difficult... </p>
