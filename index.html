			<p>He was really nervous when he came back at 4:30 Sunday afternoon. I hadn't eaten dinner so I heated up some lentil loaf with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. After dinner we lied in my bed for a bit cuddling before we fucked. We had agreed to take them at seven and it was just after seven when we looked at the clock. We sat across from eachother at my dining room table, I divied them up and started eating them, they're really not that bad plain.</p>
						
												
			<p>I was certain that I was gonna be calm and fairly unaffected and that he would be the problem. I was looking at my toe nails which I had painted bright pink with gold sparkles the day before; they looked extra bright then my feet started to look quite waxy, stetchy and unnatural. Then the nausea came. The drugs were kicking in and I was starting to freak out a bit when I told him he needed to shut the movie off because it was just too much for me, sensory overload. He did then I told him I was starting to feel the mushrooms and that I felt sick, my legs were feeling weak and I knew I might not make it to the bathroom so I went to the kitchen for a bowl to throw up in. They kicked in for him about ten minutes after me but he wasn't sick or freaking out. By now it was getting dark out and the soft pink light of the lava lamp morphed into more of a menacing red glow seeping into the hallway. The peaceful waves of the sound machine became more ominous than peaceful, sort of made it sound like the room was breathing. He stood in the doorway looking down the hallway then told me it looked scary out there and that we should stay in the nice blue office. Then he went to chair by the window and started peeking through the blinds and said we should go outside that it looked cool out there. I was the one that was like, no way I'm not stepping foot outside this apartment. </p>
						
			<p>I finally got up and told him I was going to my bed, he cautioned me again about the creepy hallway, I went anyway. It was scary at first but when I got out to the glittery centerpiece, the pink glowing ball and the huge mirror mosaic beside my bed and I knew I'd made the right decision. I called to him and told him to come to the bed, "the curtains are beautiful and the mirrors are amazing." He came and admired the mirrors with me. Other than feeling sick it was great, I laughed a lot, I was super clingy to him, like to the point of wanting to watch him take a shit so we wouldn't be separated (I think I'm glad that didn't happen). Everything looked really beautiful and I kind of couldn't get over the fact that I had made these things, that without me they wouldn't exist, I was impressed with my own creations which I'm usually quite critical of. </p>
						
			<p>He was great, I can't imagine a better person to get fucked up with, in a way it was another relationship test and we'd passed it. I was jealous of the things he saw and that he felt he could go into them, like my hair. He'd close his eyes, put his face in my hair rub the back of my head and see a bunch of colors. He was also able to go into the floor, the mattress, the curtains and his favorite, my soft freshly washed white pillow cases. He said that everytime he would go away from me and then come back to me that he would see an explosion of blue ink. </p>
						
			<p>Several times thoughout the five hours of being high I felt the urge to tell him. I didn't because I didn't want to do it when we were high. I would just look at him or he would be in my hair or sucking on my arm and I'd think, "fuck I love him." </p>
						
												
			<p>Is it possible that I've found someone to fuck, to have conversations and discuss ideas with, to do shit with and to occasionally get fucked up with? </p>
			
			<h3>Posted Dec.24 - Written May 2018 </h3>
			<p>We talked and cuddled for a while and it was during this conversation that something came up about people waiting to have sex until marriage. He thinks the sex will be good for them because they're in love. Of course I disagreed and somehow it came around to the sex with him being so good for me, he said, "obviously it's because you're in love with me." The ex accused me of being in love with The New Guy earlier that day when he came over for some website stuff. Obviously I denied this allegation both times; I can't be in love with someone after four months. </p>
						
			<p>Before I knew it it was time for him to leave. I asked him to stay and cuddle with me for ten more minutes, I love that he never says no to this, he doesn't even complain. He was lying on his back naked when I rolled on top of him; he started massaging my back, it was perfect. Naturally being on top of him with his hands all over my back quickly turned me on, after the massage  when my ten minutes were up I rolled off of him but before he could reach for his pants my hand had reached his balls. </p>
						
			<p>It didn't take long at all for him to get hard again.  He was super tired; I knew when Iâ€™d initiated this that I was on top. I went down on him again but this time I started by licking and sucking his balls before moving up for a couple of minutes to get it nice and wet to slide into my pussy.</p>
			
			<p>It was amazing the entire time. I got off and he hadn't so I kept going very slowly then as I was moving slowly lying on top of him he started pushing up and right after he came I got off AGAIN! God maybe I do love him!? Fuck. It's hard not to when the person gets you off so much and so easily. I don't even want to know how loudly I was moaning in his ear that time. That did come up in conversation earlier and I had asked, "do you ever wish I would just shut up?" He laughed, "no, I like it. It turns me on even more knowing how into it you are." </p>

			<p> Everything with him seems incredibly simple and it makes me wonder why all of my relationships before this have been so fucking difficult... </p>
